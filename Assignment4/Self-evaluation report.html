    <section id="Intro">
       
        <h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
        <p>First it is important to start off by saying that the biggest limitation is that both of us had no prior
            experience working in the web development domain. This means that all the technologies involved in the
            development of the site were unknown prior to the start of this course. As for accessibility and usability
            of the site we have built, there were many segments that we have thought about while developing and
            structuring the content. We have tried developing responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes
            and print view, to improve the usability. Some of the limitations we encountered were that existing content
            required a new form of presentation when being perceived as responsive and adaptable. The page as a whole
            has a very uniform layout with a contrasting color-scheme and a clear paragraph layout where texts and
            images are smoothly laid out on the page. Although having no acquaintance with WCAG guidelines before this
            assignment, we have somewhat managed to comply with many guidelines. That is mainly due to the fact that
            there was active comparison of our work to existing sites providing similar services (eBay, Amazon).
            Although we have not integrated functionality to all existing elements (search bar, exploring products by
            categories) , we laid a foundation for further development. </p>

        <h2><u>Accessibility highlights section</u></h2>
        <p>The WCAG guidelines cover a wide range of instructions that focus on improving the overall user experience
            and providing higher accessibility to the Web content. Some of the guidelines that we have analyzed in the
            context of our website were related to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>accessibility from a different environment (adaptable for people that intend on viewing the content in a
                different form from the primary existing); </li>
            <li>clear and meaningful structure and use of all additional methods of conveying information (with
                alternative to those that can view such additional methods);</li>
            <li>Easy navigability through the site with higher focus and more direct access to the primary content of
                the site.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For analyzing applicability of all guidelines individually to the context of our site we have started first
            with checking if the specific guideline has significant relevance to the content of our site. So we have
            determined that the cases where the guidelines are related to audio content are not applicable to our site.
            Secondly, we identified the exact purpose of the guideline, and we have tried understanding if it matches
            the situations in which the content is used on our site.
            From the list of principles on WCAG we identified 3 clear guidelines that we think clearly apply to our
            webpage:</p>


        <ul>
            <li>1.3 Adaptable: It is necessary for our site to be accessible on different screens, user agents and
                environments for all users, as many shoppers will not navigate through the content of the store using
                both visual or aural presentation at the same time. This means that we need to provide a simpler layout
                for showing the products in different categories and occurrences, without losing any information or
                structure for the cases where users might use a screen reader. Furthermore, the content should preserve
                its structure when providing alternative presentation.
                The improvement of accessibility followed by this guideline can reflect the interest of customers to
                learn and memorise the pattern of operations needed to successfully purchase products from our site.
            </li>
            <li>1.4 Distinguishable: It is crucial for us that the content of our page is easy to handle without any
                constraints of using only color for conveying information. This guideline points to the idea that
                adapting the content not to be dependably on color can enable more users to find products (possibly
                purchase them) and therefore enlarge the customer base on our site. Furthermore, the color on our site
                is used only to improve the aesthetics. As previously stated, we have not integrated any audio content,
                thus the existence of audio control mechanism is not necessary.</li>
            <li>2.4 Navigable: It is important for our page to be easily navigated, and provide the most efficient and
                comfort to the users when they are trying to look for a specific section of the page. All sections
                require proper title. Given the fact that the nature of our website is e-commerce, there might be cases
                where certain products are promoted or displayed as block elements appearing after the whole page loads,
                or simple advertisement methods. In such cases it is important not to overlook the users that will be
                viewing the site using different user agents. Including section titles and page titles can decrease the
                time needed for users to find specific products or view other relevant products.
                For the case where new items are added to the top selling items table, the focus order plays an
                important role, since it enables navigating through input fields easily, without jumping to other
                sections of the page.</li>
        </ul>

                    <td>Fails to comply</td>
                    <td>1.1.1 <strong>Non-text Content: </strong>Most of the content on our site is conveyed in a text
                        form, with the exception of few images. However, the guideline clearly states that there is
                        exemption of the content that is used for “decoration”, and as we have provided the image under
                        the navigation bar that serves for such purposes, it clearly has an exemption. However, for
                        every other case of non-text content, the situation of products listed in tables, we have not
                        provided sufficient text alternatives to images, as the products were dynamically generated by
                        user input. Therefore we do not comply fully with this guideline.(Level A) </td>

                    <td>1.3</td>
                    <td>Partially complies</td>
                    <td>1.3.1 <strong>Info and Relationships:</strong> Based on the “understanding” section of the
                        guideline, it implies that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory
                        formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. Given the fact that we have used
                        HTML structure only for semantics (not decoration or appearance), all content should retain its
                        visual relationship in case of style sheet substitution. In terms of responsiveness of the
                        content when viewed on a different screen, we have had some issues with media query at some
                        screen size, and it was directly related to this guideline, as it disrupted the information and
                        relationship between content. Overall, the structure and relationship of the content of our site
                        did ensure that information important for comprehension will be perceivable to all. (Level
                        A)<br>
                        1.3.2 <strong>Meaningful Sequence: </strong>As the guideline “success criterion” states, the
                        intent is to provide an alternative presentation of content while preserving reading order
                        needed to understand the meaning. This could translate to providing an adequate print view of
                        the content, or creating responsive design for the cases when content is viewed on different
                        screens. By analyzing the site we have built, we have provided a somewhat sufficient print and
                        responsive interface. However, there was some TA feedback suggesting that we had some issues
                        with the media queries in CSS, and those issues were related to preserving reading order needed
                        to understand the meaning. The print view had issues with the placement and viewing of the
                        “about us” section. (Level A)<br>
                        1.3.3 <strong> Sensory Characteristics:</strong>This guideline is related to any content that
                        uses shape, size, spatial location or orientations (or any other visual cue) for navigation and
                        the use of the website. Such content needs to have adequate text alternatives or information
                        explaining the actions. As for our site, there is no content that uses any of the above
                        mentioned attributes for accessibility purposes. Therefore we do comply with this part of the
                        guideline.<br>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.4</td>
                    <td>Fully complies</td>
                    <td>1.4.1 <strong>Use of Color:</strong> As the guideline suggests, all information conveyed by
                        using color (meaningfully) should have some form of alternative for the case where the user
                        might not perceive color difference. In the case of our site, the use of colors heavily relies
                        on the aesthetic of the site, thus there are no cases where particular meaningful information is
                        provided only using color differences. There is only a case where color change is triggered
                        using CSS hover or focus effect indicating the use of a particular element or input form. For
                        such cases we have not provided any alternative information as it seems redundant. When it comes
                        to paragraph sections, the colors are set to provide the contrast from the background, and
                        therefore improve readability. (Level A)<br>
                        1.4.2 <strong>Audio Control:</strong> This guideline is related to audio content, and as we do
                        not have any it is not applicable. (Level A)
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.1</td>
                    <td>Fully complies</td>
                    <td>2.1.1<strong> Keyboard:</strong> The intent of this guideline is to ensure that all content can
                        be operated through the keyboard or keyboard interface. As we have only used simple HTML content
                        (without any interactive graphics, integrated web application), we have relied on the browser's
                        integrated keyboard accessibility. The site can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys, and all
                        hyperlinks can be accessed using tab key and (shift + tab keys). (Level A)<br>
                        2.1.2 <strong>No Keyboard Trap:</strong> The guideline explanations suggest that keyboard traps
                        are a common problem when multiple formats are combined within a page and rendered using
                        plug-ins or embedded applications. As previously stated in the guideline above, the contents of
                        our site are HTML elements, and thus we have not encountered any “keyboard traps” while
                        navigating throughout the site using the keyboard interface. (Level A)

                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.4</td>
                    <td>Fully complies</td>
                    <td>2.4.1 <strong>Bypass Blocks:</strong> The intent of this guideline is to allow users more direct
                        access to the primary content of the web page, by bypassing blocks of content that are repeated
                        on multiple web pages. From the context of the guideline, types of such content could be
                        advertisements, additional screens or block elements that are not related to the primary
                        content. Given the fact that we do not have any non-related or repeating content we can consider
                        saying that we comply or the guideline is not applicable to our site.<br>
                        2.4.2 <strong>Page Titled:</strong> This guideline ensures that the users are able to find
                        content and orient themselves within the site by requiring descriptive titles for the content.
                        By having the HTML title, navigation bar, and heading for every section of our site we fully
                        comply with this guideline.<br>
                        2.4.3 <strong>Focus Order:</strong> The success criterion for this guideline ensures that
                        navigation through site is consistent with the meaning of the content and can be operated from
                        the keyboard. By analyzing the navigation on our site with a keyboard interface, we have noticed
                        that the navigation follows sequential navigation. To further illustrate, the movement from the
                        top of the page to the button using tab key does not skip any links that are present, and
                        follows an ordered pattern. However, the movement through “explore popular products by
                        categories” follows the HTML order, meaning that it jumps to the second column after finishing
                        the list items from the first. When it comes to input form for adding new items to the table,
                        every input field is triggered following the visible pattern.<br>
                        2.4.4 <strong>Link Purpose (In Context):</strong> Based on the guideline explanation, every
                        hyperlink should be understandable, allowing users to decide whether they want to navigate to
                        it. We have provided clear meaning, purpose and destination for every hyperlink present on our
                        site, thus there are no unclear actions behind pressing any link element. Thus we comply with
                        this part of the guideline.<br>

    <section id="Improvemnet-Plan">
        <h2>Improvement plan</h2>
        <h3>Overview of the improvements</h3>
        <p>
            Our approach to improvements is based on assessing the site as a whole and understanding which of its
            components are affecting the usability and accessibility of the site. As we have analyzed the WCAG
            guidelines and the TA feedback, we came to an idea of devising a list of issues organized by the source of
            the information. Afterward we worked on creating a list with prioritized improvements and execution plans,
            where every element of the list addresses all issues specified in Appendixes A and B.
            Starting from Appendix A, the guidelines that we have failed to comply with are directly related to the
            responsiveness, alternative view of the site and preserving the structure of the site while being presented
            in alternative viewing modes.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Firstly, there was a particular non-compliance issue related to providing alternative text description
                for non-text elements. This was caused by the fact that images presented in the “Top selling item” table
                were dynamically generated from the database, and the HTML “alt” (image alternative) attribute has been
                overlooked while developing the Javascript function that rendered new items to the table. </li>
            <li>We haven’t also managed to retain the meaningful structure by creating a responsive design that adapts
                to all screens sizes. By inspecting clearly the style sheet (CSS) we identified the problem with the
                table, where table data does not resize appropriately and causes elements on the site to collide. </li>
            <li>Final issue with guideline compliance was a print view, where the structure and presentation of the
                document was out of proportion and also the coloring of the text once in print view was not appropriate.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Moving to Appendix B, some of the improvement suggestions were related to technical implementation, that
            does not directly correlate with usability of accessibility aspects of the site. Cases of such feedback were
            using style-oriented markup in Javascript, not utilizing all CSS attributes (or using shorthand versions).
            However, there were many comments related to “a potentially negative aspect of your submission that could be
            used to improve the usability or accessibility of your page”. Such situations were responsiveness and print
            view of the page, and also to dynamical functionality like sorting and resetting products in table.
            Prioritized list of improvements with plan
        </p>

        <h3>Prioritized list of improvements with plan:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first aspect of the site that we are planning to work on and improve is to make the page responsive
                to all screen sizes and fix the. The execution plan starts with locating the element on the page that
                causes the problem. We will start with inspecting HTML elements individually by changing “display”
                property to “none” and seeing if it makes any changes to the document. This will cause a situation where
                certain elements will not be rendered in the browser, and will allow us to identify particular elements
                that cause the site to break at certain screen sizes. After finding the particular element that causes
                the problem, we will try to apply relative units to text or image content for a certain media query.
                This will cause resizing of the content to fit all views. By fixing these issues we directly address
                guidelines 1.3 and TA feedback regarding responsive design </li>
            <li>Second improvement is related to the print view. The current version of the site has issues with the
                placement of the content and font styling. We will first start with analyzing the style sheet section
                related to the print view. As the first problem is with the placement of the “about us” section, we will
                try to position it to the second page and create a proper page break. Next we will try fixing the font
                styling by applying the uniform color to all the text and improving font sizes on the first page so that
                it improves readability of the document. By fixing this issue we directly address the guideline 1.3 and
                TA
                feedback regarding the print style</li>
            <li>
                Third point for improvment is adding providing the alternative text description for non-text elements.
                This is related to the images of items in "Top Selling Items" table. All images were generated
                dynamically (using Javascript) and therefore we have overlook adding "alt" attributes to the "img"
                elements. The solution would be simply to identify the line were content is dynamically added from the
                server response, and to add appropriate "alt" text. We will perform that by adding product name to "alt"
                and concatenate with string "image".
            </li>
            <li>Fourth point for improvement is fixing issues with sorting functionality of the table that loads data
                dynamically from the HTTP response body. We will first start with examining the both function that deals
                with sorting and function that converts the JSON response and deals with rendering it to the table. The
                suspected issue might be in loading the data from the response to the table, as it replaces HTML tbody
                element with the response converted into HTML elements respectively. We will try to confirm this by user
                developer tools in our browser and analyze the outcome of both actions (sorting and resetting) By fixing
                these issues we directly improve the usability of the site and address guidelines 1.3.2 and TA feedback
                regarding reset button.
            </li>
            <li>So far all improvements were related to usability and accessibility, this next improvement addresses an
                issue that might not directly be related to the above mentioned, but still plays an important role in
                functionality of the website. The issue is related to using the “serialize()” method on POST request.
                This causes the request body to be encoded in the URI. We will start first by observing the information
                provided by the input form. There should be an object containing all the values that the user passes in.
                After identifying such an object we will try to extract the submitted values (from text input) and we
                might create a new additional object to which we will assign all key-value pairs that are relevant to
                the required form of the request. So in the end we will have a new object where all the input text was
                assigned to the corresponding key ({“item” :” “apple”}). The final stage would be passing this object to
                the POST request function and possibly using “JSON.stringify” method on the object, to convert all the
                content to appropriate format for the request. </li>
            <li>As the final stage of our improvement we will try doing the bonus part, integrating our localhost server
                into the client side application. First step would be changing all URI endpoints to
                “http://localhost:3000/api/items”. Since not all “CRUD” operations were performed in the previous
                assignment, we might want to think of an appropriate way for handling all operations from the client
                side interface. This will require creating buttons in HTML for every element in the table, enabling
                removal of that specific element. Next issue could be dealing with updating the product, where we might
                address it by changing the content of the table data to text input when a certain table cell is clicked.
                And might finalize everything with deploying localhost server and testing all the functionality from the
                client side app. </li>
