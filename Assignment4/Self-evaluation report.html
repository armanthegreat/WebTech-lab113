    <h1>Assignment 4</h1>
    <p>Our online store is a dynamic web page created to be easily used by multiple users on various devices. 
        It presents the data to the user in a very coherent and user-friendly format. Starting from the top of the page; 
        we included a navigation bar to assist the user to browse through the page and have a direct link to their desired 
        part of the webpage. Going a little down we have added a very easy to use product catalog that shows the available 
        products in the store in a very organized manner. Following that we have also added an interactive table that allows 
        the customers to access and add new items to the table. We end the page with a short description of the store and its 
        goals we have been striving towards. The page in general has a very uniform layout with a matching color-scheme and a 
        clear paragraph layout where texts and images are smoothly laid out on the page.
         // However, due to the timestarint and the basic knowledge we had some functionality didnt work as planned such as; 
         the sorting functionality //
    </p>
    <p>From the list of guidelines on WCAG we identified 3 clear principales that we think clearly applies to our webpage they are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1.3 Adaptable: It is necessary for our page to be accessible for users on different screens as many shoppers will not be looking at the store from their computers so we made sure to keep a simple but elegant design for smaller screen sizes where it conveys the main information of the page to the users.</li>
        <li>1.4 Distinguishable: It is crucial for us that our page is accessible by everyone so we have made sure that we didn't use any colors on our text and keep a good color contrast between the text and the background to make it visible even for people with disabilities.</li>
        <li>2.4 Navigation: It is important for our page to be navigational to provide the most efficient and comfort to the users when they are trying to look for a specific section of the page. </li>
    
    </ul>

                <td>1.1.1 Non-text Content Most of the content on our site is conveyed in a text form, with the exception of few images. However, the Guideline clearly states that there is exemption of the content that is used for “decoration” . As we have provided the image under the navigation bar that serves for such purposes, we have considered adding any additional explanation. However, for every other case of non-text content we have not also provided proper text alternatives for the situations listed in the guideline. (Level A)

            <tr>
                <td>1.3</td>
                <td>Partial compliance</td>
                <td>1.3.1 Info and Relationships: Based on the “understanding” section of the guideline, it implies that information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are preserved when the presentation format changes. Given the fact that we have used HTML structure only for semantics (not decoration or appearance), all content should retain its visual relationship in case of style sheet substitution. In terms of responsiveness of the content when viewed on a different screen, we have had some issues with media query at some screen size, and it was directly related to this guideline, as it disrupted the information and relationship between content. Overall, the structure and relationship of the content of our site did ensure that information important for comprehension will be perceivable to all. (Level A)

                    1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence: As the guideline success criterion states, the intent is to enable a s user agent to provide an alternative presentation of content while preserving reading order needed to understand the meaning. This could translate to providing an adequate print view of the content, or creating responsive design for the cases when content is viewed on different screens. By analyzing the site we have built, we have provided a somewhat sufficient print and responsive interface. However, there was some TA feedback suggesting that we had some issues with the media queries in CSS, and those issues were related to preserving reading order needed to understand the meaning. The print view had issues with the placement of the “about us” section. (Level A)

                <td>Comply</td>
                <td>1.4.1 Use of Color: As the guideline suggests, all information conveyed by using color (meaningfully) should have some form of alternative for the case where the user might not perceive color difference. In the case of our site, the use of colors heavily relies on the aesthetic of the site, thus there are no cases where particular meaningful information is provided using color differences. There is only a case where color change is triggered using CSS hover or focus effect indicating the use of a particular element of input form. For such cases we have not provided any alternative information, as it seems redundant. When it comes to text content, the colors are set to provide the contrast from the background, and therefore improve readability. 


                    1.4.2 Audio Control: This guideline is related to audio content, and as we do not have any we will omit it.</td>

                <td>2.1.1 Keyboard:

                    As we only use simple HTML content, we have only relied on the browser's integrated keyboard accessibility. The site can be navigated using keyboard arrow keys, and all hyperlinks can be accessed using tab key. However, for any other content (table data, text paragraph, images) we haven’t provided any additional keyboard accessibility.
                    
                    We have not encountered any “keyboard traps” while navigating throughout the site using the keyboard interface.

Improvement plan :
    Our approach to improvements is based on assessing the site as a whole and understanding which of its components are affecting the usability and accessibility. 
    As we have analyzed the WCAG guidelines and the TA feedback, we came to an idea of devising a list ordered by prioritization.
